***********************
Lesson:

Make an app that lets people design and take surveys. Here are some user stories:

*  As a survey designer, I want to create a new survey, so that I can get people's opinion on important matters.

*  As a survey designer, I want to add questions to my survey, so that I can find out what people think about them.

*  As a survey designer, I want to add possible responses to each question, so that I can structure people's opinions into discrete choices that they must choose among. At this point, I want all questions to be multiple-choice, pick one.
